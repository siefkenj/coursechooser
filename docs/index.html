	<h2 id="basic-usage">Basic Usage</h2>
	<p>CourseMapper allows you to create charts
	showing how an ideal student might progress through
	a particular major (possibly with specialty).
	These charts can be used for planning purposes, or
	they can be embedded on your department webpage to help
	students navigate their degree program.  <emph>Charts produced
	by CourseMapper are meant to give perspective on the flow
	of a program, but are not meant to include every detail of
	a particular major or in any way replace the calendar as 
	the source for university requirements.</emph></p>

	<h4 id="StructureofCourseMapper">Structure of CourseMapper</h4>
	<p>The CourseMapper application
	has two main components: Course Chooser and Preview. 
	Each component of CourseMapper can be accessed via the black menubar
	at the top of the CourseMapper page.  Course Chooser allows you to load
	and inspect (look at pre-reqs, course descriptions, historical offerings)
	any courses from the Banner database and then select the courses
	you wish to include in your program.  Preview is where you see a
	flow-chart representation of your program with arrows 
	representing prerequisites. In Preview you can also adjust which arrows
	show up, make co-requisites, and add extra data about electives
	(like links to detailed webpage descriptions).</p>
	
	<h4 id="Navigation">Navigation</h4>
	<p>Changing views as well as loading and saving is done via the black
	navigation bar at the top of the CourseMapper page.  This bar should be used
	to change between <emph>Welcome</emph>, <emph>Course Chooser</emph>, and <emph>Preview</emph> views
	instead of the browsers forward and back buttons.</p>
	
	<h4 id="CreatingaChart">Creating a Chart</h4>
	<p>
		To create a chart, go to the <emph>Welcome</emph> page, enter the 
		title of your program and click <op>Next</op> to proceed to the
		<emph>Course Chooser</emph> page.  If there is already an old course map loaded,
		click the <op>New</op> button in the top right of the black menubar to
		clear the current chart and start afresh.
		
		<img class="doc-image" src="basic-1.png" width="500px">
	</p>
	<p>
		In the <emph>Subjects to Add</emph> textbox,
		enter subjects or courses you wish to choose from in
		a comma separated list; then, click <op>Show</op>. If you enter
		a course subject, for example <emph>MATH</emph>, then all courses
		from that subject will be shown. If you enter a full course designation,
		for example <emph>MATH 100</emph>, then only that particular course will
		be displayed.  (This
		means, if you already know exactly which courses belong in your program,
		you can just enter them in a comma-separated list and only those courses will
		be loaded).  <emph>Note: courses loaded here come directly from a clone
		of the banner database,
		so courses that do not exist on banner cannot be loaded.</emph>
		
		<img class="doc-image" src="basic-2.png" width="500px">
	</p>
	<p>
		After you hit <op>Show</op>, you will see a host of gray courses
		displayed in the year chart.  Gray courses will not show up in your final
		graph.  Instead, we must mark courses that we want to include as <emph>Required</emph>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Marking courses as Required can be done in two ways: double click a course or
		click a course once and then in the <emph>Course Info</emph> tab on the right,
		click the <op>Required</op> button.  A course can be made not required similarly,
		by double clicking or clicking the <op>Not Included</op> button after selecting the course.
	</p>
	<p>
		After you have selected all the courses required for your program, click
		the <op>Preview</op> button in the top menubar to be taken to the graphical
		version of your chart.
		
		<img class="doc-image" src="basic-3.png" width="500px">
	</p>
	<p>
		If you're happy with your program chart, you can click <op>Save</op> in
		the top menubar, or you can click <op>Course Chooser</op> to
		return to editing the courses in your chart.
		
		<img class="doc-image" src="basic-4.png" width="500px">
	</p>
	<p>
		Course charts are saved in the <emph>SVG</emph> file format.  This file format
		can be displayed by most web browsers and can be loaded back in CourseMapper
		for future editing.  However, for maximum portability, you can export your
		<emph>SVG</emph> to an image or <emph>PDF</emph>. See <a href="#exporting">Exporting
		to Other Graphical Formats</a>.
	</p>
	
	<h2 id="exporting">Exporting to Other Graphical Formats</h2>
	<p>
		When you save a chart from CourseMapper, it is saved as an
		<emph>SVG</emph> image.  Embedded in this image is all the data
		needed to reload and continue working on/edit your chart in the future.
		However, you may wish to convert your chart to different file formats
		for putting on your webpage or distributing.
	</p>
	<p>
		To convert your chart you will need the free program 
		<emph>Inkscape</emph>. You can download Inkscape for Mac,
		Windows, and Linux at
		<a href="http://inkscape.org/">inkscape.org</a>.
	</p>
	<h4 id="ExportingtoImagePNG">Exporting to Image (PNG)</h4>
	<p>
		<emph>PNG</emph> is a static image format suitable to include
		on your department webpage.  To export your chart to a PNG,
		first open it in Inkscape. Then, choose <emph>File</emph> &gt; 
		<emph>Export Bitmap</emph> from the Inkscape menu.
	</p>
	<p>
		When the export dialog appears, click <op>Browse</op> to choose
		a file name.  Make sure you include a <emph>.png</emph> at
		the end of your filename.
		Finally, click the <op>Export</op> button, and your image
		will be saved.
		<img class="doc-image" src="export-png.png" width="500px">
	</p>
	<h4 id="ExportingtoPDF">Exporting to PDF</h4>
	<p>
		To export your chart to a <emph>PDF</emph>, open the <emph>SVG</emph>
		version in Inkscape, and then select <emph>File</emph> &gt; <emph>Save As</emph>
		from the Inkscape menu. Then, select <emph>Portable Document Format</emph> from
		the list of Save-As types in the Save As dialog.
		<img class="doc-image" src="export-pdf-1.png" width="500px">
	</p>
	<p>
		Click <op>Save</op> and when presented with the <emph>PDF</emph> export options,
		click <op>OK</op>.  Your <emph>PDF</emph> should now be saved.
		<img class="doc-image" src="export-pdf-2.png" width="500px">
	</p>


	<h2 id="adjusting">Adjusting Your Chart</h2>
	<p>
		Outlined are many of the ways you may wish to fine-tune your
		chart.  
	</p>
	<h4 id="ChangingtheYearofaCourse">Changing the Year of a Course</h4>
	<p>
		By default, courses are sorted into years by their course number.
		If you wish to change the year a course should be taken in, go
		to the <emph>Course Chooser</emph> page and drag and
		drop that course to the appropriate year in the year chart.
		<img class="doc-image" src="adjusting-year.png" width="500px">
	</p>
	<h4 id="HidingorCreatingArrows">Hiding or Creating Arrows</h4>
	<p>
		By default, all arrows that appear are given
		by prerequisites listed in Banner. You may want to add or hide
		arrows to help the flow of your program.  To hide an
		arrow, go to the <emph>Preview</emph>
		page and click the two courses connected by the arrow you wish to hide.
		Then click the <op>Remove Arrow</op> button.
		<img class="doc-image" src="adjusting-remove-arrow.png" width="500px">
	</p>
	<p>
		To create an arrow, from the <emph>Preview</emph> page, select the two courses
		you wish to create an arrow between from tail to head.  That is, <emph>if you
		want an arrow from course A to course B, select course A first, and then select
		course B</emph>.  Then, click the <op>Create Arrow</op> button.  If you mistakenly
		create an arrow in the wrong direction, click <op>Remove Arrow</op>, deselect the 
		two courses (by clicking on each of them once more), select them in the opposite
		order, and click <op>Create Arrow</op> again.
		<img class="doc-image" src="adjusting-create-arrow.png" width="500px">
	</p>
	<h4 id="CreatingaCorequisite">Creating a Co-requisite</h4>
	<p>
		By default, all requirements are shown as prerequisites, but your program
		may have co-requisites.  To create a co-requisite, select the two courses
		you wish to be co-requisite (there must already be an arrow between them
		or you must create an arrow between them for the next step) and click the 
		<op>Make Corequisite</op> button.  The arrow will now be headless and the two
		courses should be shown in the same column.  To return a course to a pre-requisite,
		select the two co-requisite courses and click <op>Make Prerequisite</op>.
		<img class="doc-image" src="adjusting-coreq.png" width="500px">
	</p>
	
	<h2 id="prereqs">Checking Prereqs</h2>
	<p>
		CourseMapper has knowledge of all the prerequisites listed in Banner and gives you two
		different ways to view this information.  It should be noted that CourseMapper interprets every
		requirement in Banner as a pre-requisite.  Co-requisites must be specified manually as explained
		in the <a href="#adjusting">Adjusting</a> section.
	</p>
	<h4 id="IndividualCoursesPrerequisites">Individual Course's Prerequisites</h4>
	<p>
		To view an individual course's prerequisites, while on the <emph>Course Chooser</emph>,
		click the <op>Course Info</op> tab on the right side.  Under the words <emph>Pre-requisites</emph>
		will be a list of all the course's prerequisites. Prerequisites are either in a boxed group, which
		means any of the courses in the box may fulfill the requirement, or they are separated by the word
		<emph>and</emph> to signify that course or block of courses is required.  Courses you have already 
		marked as required or elective in your chart are shown as required or elective in the prerequisites
		list.  Courses that are half-grayed out are courses listed as prerequisites in Banner but are no
		longer offered.
	</p>
	<p>
		To fulfill missing requirements, either add the course and make it required via the <emph>Subjects to Add</emph>
		textbox, or click the course in the <emph>Pre-requisites</emph> list to have it automatically added.  The graphic
		shows that our program is missing one of the requirements for MATH342.
		<img class="doc-image" src="prereq-1.png" width="500px">
	</p>
	<h4 id="CheckingaProgramsUnmetPrerequisites">Checking a Program's Unmet Prerequisites</h4>
	<p>
		Because verifying that every course's prerequisites are satisfied one at a time is time tedious, 
		CourseMapper provides a way to look at all unmet prerequisites.  From the <emph>Course Chooser</emph> page,
		clicking the <op>Prerequisites</op> tab on the right-hand side will give a (possibly empty) list
		of unmet prerequisites.  If the list is empty, all prerequisites for all required courses in your program
		are met.  Otherwise, as is the case in the image, you will see a list of prerequisites that need to be 
		satisfied.  Once they are satisfied, they will disappear from this list.
		<img class="doc-image" src="prereq-2.png" width="500px">
	</p>
	<p>
		The unmet prerequisites list will dynamically update as you change your program.  For example, if we unrequire
		MATH100 and MATH101 from our program, we see they appear in the unmet prerequisites list (with MATH101 appearing
		twice because it is required by both MATH200 and MATH201).
		<img class="doc-image" src="prereq-3.png" width="500px">
	</p>
	<h2 id="electives">Adding Electives</h2>
	<p>
		CourseMapper allows you to add two different types of electives: an electives descriptor 
		and an electives block.  An electives descriptor will appear as a gray box displaying
		the text you specify on your graphical
		chart.  An elective block contains an explicit list of options for courses that satisfy 
		that elective.
	</p>
	<p>
		Note that <emph>Electives</emph> is just the word we use to describe an element of your
		graph where a student has a choice.  It may be a requirement of your program, and you need
		not have the word "elective" appear on your graphical chart.
	</p>
	<h4 id="ElectiveDescriptors">Elective Descriptors</h4>
	<p>
		To create an elective descriptor, from the <emph>Course Chooser</emph> page, click the <op>Electives</op>
		tab to the right.  Then, click on <op>Create New Electives Block</op>. A gray electives box will show
		up on your year chart.  
		<img class="doc-image" src="electives-1.png" width="500px">
	</p>
	<p>
		You may drag and drop this electives box to the desired year and edit the title and required
		number of units to suit your needs.
		<img class="doc-image" src="electives-2.png" width="500px">
	</p>
	<p>
		Elective descriptors can also include extra descriptions and links to further information.  To
		add this data, go to the <emph>Preview and click your elective descriptor.  On the right
		you will be presented with a place to enter a description and a link to more information.
		<img class="doc-image" src="electives-3.png" width="500px">
	</emph></p>
	<h4 id="ElectiveBlock">Elective Block</h4>
	<p>
		The difference between an elective descriptor and an elective block is that an elective block has an
		explicit list of courses listed to choose from.  To create an elective block, the procedure is the
		same: From the <emph>Course Chooser</emph> page, click the <op>Electives</op> tab to the right and 
		click <op>Create New Electives Block</op>.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the same way as elective descriptors, you can edit the text and required units of your
		elective block.
	</p>
	<p>
		To populate your elective block with courses, drag and drop them into the elective block.
		<img class="doc-image" src="electives-block-1.png" width="500px">
	</p>
	<p>
		Your electives block will show up in your graphical chart as a gray box enclosing every 
		course you specified.  It should be noted that the prerequisites of the courses specified
		in your elective block will be included in the <emph>Prerequisites</emph> tab in CourseMapper
		and prerequisite arrows will appear in the graphical chart.  If your course options have complicated
		prerequisites between eachother, CourseMapper will attempt to structure them, but this
		may result in a strange looking chart.
		<img class="doc-image" src="electives-block-2.png" width="500px">
	</p>
	<h4 id="DeletingElectives">Deleting Electives</h4>
	<p>
		To delete an elective descriptor or an elective block, from the <emph>Course Chooser</emph> page, click the 
		<op>Electives</op> tab and click the trash icon in the upper-right of the elective you wish to delete.
		<img class="doc-image" src="electives-4.png" width="500px">
	</p>
	
	<h2 id="basic-usage">Co-ops</h2>
	<p>
		Co-ops are treated differently by CourseMapper than a regular course, 
		since co-op requirement normally span several years and offer great flexibility
		as to the term they are taken in.  To create a co-op, from the <emph>Course Chooser</emph>
		page, click the <op>Co-ops</op> tab to the right and then click <op>Create New Co-op</op>
		<img class="doc-image" src="coop-1.png" width="500px">
	</p>
	<p>
		You co-op will not show up in list of courses on the <emph>Course Chooser</emph> page,
		but it will show up in the graphical version of your chart.  After creating a co-op,
		you should specify its label (description), the year-span you wish it to show up for,
		and a link to more information about that co-op and its requirements.
		<img class="doc-image" src="coop-2.png" width="500px">
	</p>
	<p>
		When you click <op>Preview</op> you will now see a co-op banner spanning the years 
		you specified.
		<img class="doc-image" src="coop-3.png" width="500px">
	</p>
	
	<h2 id="creation">Who created CourseMapper?</h2>
	<p>
		CourseMapper was originally the idea of <a href="http://ltc.uvic.ca/about/contacts.php">Teresa Dawson</a> of the
		UVic Learning and Teaching Center.  She was hoping for a tool to help faculties design and redesign their
		curricula. She teamed up with Math Ph.D. candidate <a href="http://web.uvic.ca/~siefkenj/homepage/index.html">Jason Siefken</a>
		for the technical and programming part, and the results of their collaboration have far exceeded anyones initial expectations.
